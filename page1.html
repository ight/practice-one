    <h1>This is my first page</h1>
    <p>Lets do some html and css to add soem design and color to life
      HTML and CSS are the most importnat componet of Internet world.
      All the pages that we see around the internet are HTML content.
    </p>
    <div id="error">
      this is a normal text not binded by p tag its directly under the <br>
      div with id error this should get chnaged to red. Where as the below text <br>
      is warped in a p tag so the style written for p tag should work on it and it <br>
      should be in Blue color 
      <p> This is an error message in p tag but <br>
       the div has an id as error which we will set with a diffrent ,<br>
      color using css. So the default p tag style should get overide</p>
      <p class="black-text"> This text will be in black as we are going to set <br>
      a class for this p tag as black-text and set the property color as black<br>
      but this should not impact the above p tag style which sets the p tag color propert to<br>
      blue.</p>
